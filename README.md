# Titanic Dataset Analysis and Decision Tree Classifier

## Overview
This repository contains code and analysis for exploring the Titanic dataset and applying a Decision Tree Classifier using Python.


## Dataset
The Titanic dataset includes information about passengers, such as age, gender, class, and survival status.

## Analysis and Model
1. **Data Exploration:**
   - Loaded and explored the Titanic dataset.
   - Checked for missing values and handled them by filling in the mean age.

2. **Feature Selection:**
   - Selected features: Pclass, Sex, Age, Fare.
   - Encoded categorical variable 'Sex' using Label Encoding.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Used a Decision Tree Classifier from scikit-learn.
   - Achieved an impressive model accuracy score.

4. **Prediction Example:**
   - Tested the model with a prediction for a sample input.

5. **Evaluation:**
   - Assessed model performance using a confusion matrix heatmap.
